# Schoolshooting Website
## Project Description

This project was created to test the knowledge of Frontend website design. Developed as part of a scientific initiative, it addresses the issue of school shootings and their prevention. The website was built using HTML and CSS, showcasing key solutions and preventive measures. It was presented at four international project competitions, earning two silver and two bronze awards.
 
## Features
The website features five primary sections:
+ Relevance: A detailed section providing insights into the urgency and significance of the issue of school shootings, backed by statistics and research findings.
+ Warning Signs: A section dedicated to book related to school shootings. "Warning Signs" by Dr. Langman, offering practical, research-based guidance on preventing school violence. For those interested in the book, the website provides links to search for it in libraries or purchase it online.
+ School Shooters: "School Shooters: Understanding High School, College, and Adult Perpetrators" by Dr. Peter Langman, which analyzes real cases to dispel myths, explore motives, and provide actionable insights for preventing future incidents. For those interested in the book, the website provides links to search for it in libraries or purchase it online.
+ Categories: Explains the different psychological profiles and types of school shooters, based on research. It categorizes them into psychopathic, traumatized, and other types, helping users understand the complexity and patterns behind such actions.
+ Our Approach: Discusses a two-step strategy to address school shootings, involving new research-based methods and programs designed to foster a safe and supportive school environment. Emphasizes reducing bullying, improving psychological support, and creating a culture of empathy and respect within schools.
