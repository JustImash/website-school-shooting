First one is basic new researched methods.And the second one is two special programs designed by us. We will talk about them later
    Creating a friendly atmosphere 
    Restricting the shooter's personal information 
    Psychological assistance in school
    Attention to prerequisites
    Reduce bullying
  <br>
<br><br>
In an attempt to stop these events, as shown in the examples above, the state seeks to prevent the consequences. But this way of solving the problem is not correct, because it will not work to be safe from everything. This problem is quite complex and it is impossible to find a single solution. A complex problem requires a complex solution. Decisions of the type to put armed guards, to instruct psychologists in educational institutions are not the key to solving the whole problem, but only part of it.
We must consider this problem more deeply. Make sure that this thought does not come to people. Find the root of the whole problem.
Bullying and how to deal with it
Some students are bullied by others. Classmates, teachers, friends, parents, all of them are to blame for the psychological deviation of the killer. We believe that everyone should be tolerant towards each other. Students and teachers of the school must follow the rules of showing tolerance towards each other. There must be a framework that every teacher and student must adhere to. If the rule was violated not only by the student, but also by the teacher, the witness must immediately tell the leadership of the educational institution about the incident. After all, bullying is one of the fundamental factors in all these incidents. A person has been subjected to physical and psychological abuse for a long time. People need to become more attentive and try to pay attention to the minimum difficulties of others in order to support them.

Conclusion: Schools must take strong measures to prevent any form of bullying, regardless of who the bully is, the student or the teacher. 
The school must conduct anonymous surveys to find students who are subject to bullying. 
Create new rules towards bullying
The first prerequisites of the murder

As mentioned above, the murderers often talked about their intentions. Regardless of where the killer shared his plans, users or friends simply ignored their words. If government agencies knew about the future plans of the killers, there would be no tragic fatalities. So the solution could be to supervise the teachers and ask classmates to report any deviations. The solution is to notify the parents or teachers of the institution of impending dangers. Even if the words were spoken without physical embodiment, psychological help will be needed.

Conclusion: People need to become more attentive to each other. And he takes it more seriously. People should report various oddities in the behavior of other people and contact the administration
Harm to the media

One of the main problems is the widespread publicity of such incidents. Nowadays, these cases are a horrifying precedent that is sure to be covered in all types of mass media. Of course, people should know about these incidents, but not on such a scale as now, a lot of interviews, reports. 
Many bloggers share their opinions about these cases, and many celebrities speak out about it. In the sum of all this, there is such a popularity effect.
Because of such popularity, there is a huge risk of imitators who have one desire - to become famous. This is a chance to leave your mark on history in this way. Some shooters were motivated by the desire for glory. Which the media and other figures are satisfied with. Each of us knows the names, history and much more about the people who committed these terrible acts. They achieved their goal, they left their mark. Consider the same example, linked at Virginia Polytechnic Institute, in which the attacker was inspired by the incident in Columbine and wanted to repeat the second "Columbine, so that the world will remember it in this light."
One of our solutions is to censor the shooter's personal information.Fan groups about school shootings should be blocked because 	many of the attackers had a schoolobsession.shootingThese incidents will be covered. But all information related to the shooter will be censored. As a result, the desire to become famous will disappear, this will directly affect the number of these cases. After all, when he commits this crime, he will know that no one will know anything about him.
We adhered to this principle when working with this project, we do not indicate personal information of the shooters. Thus, leaving these people in obscurity. After all, these people are not worthy to remain in history.

Conclusion:The government must censor all personal information associated with the shooter.  Information about the incident will continue to be highlighted, but all information is somehow related to the shooter: Name, Character, Family will be prohibited
Psychologists at school

Schools should increase the quality and quantity of psychologists in schools. The number of visits to the school counselor should be accounted for up to one visit each month. Students noticed with references to murder and students with psychological disabilities should be under the close supervision of not only psychologists, but also other school workers.

Conclusion: The school should have a sufficient number of professional psychologists and specialists in order to prevent such cases. Psychologists will help children with their problems and thereby reduce the percentage of such cases. Elimination of the problem at the stage of its formation.
Maintain a friendly atmosphere

Having asked this question, we sorted out the many and came to the conclusion that there is no better way than united by a common goal. Most of the shooters were loners and social outcasts. They were rejected from everywhere. We believe that the solution may be to increase the number of any collective events that can bring people together. For example, project work, various events, sports competitions. teamwork will help to integrate into the team and feel like a part of society. Responsibility, support, mutual assistance and understanding, communication - these are the qualities that will develop in the team and will directly affect the number of shooters. A school is a place where children, a huge number of people study, and not everyone will be able to join the team, which can affect their studies and relationships with classmates. Thanks to close-knit, vigorous activity, people acquire warm relations with each other.

Conclusion: The school should conduct various activities to unite the team and help people adapt to society. With the help of these activities, a person feels like a part of the whole, which is why it is so important.

<h1>Relationship Improvement Program</h1>
How should parents prevent school shootings? 
Neither parent encouraged their child to commit murder or helped plan attacks. But it is worth admitting that many parents knew about the aggressive prejudices of their children, but still turned a blind eye to it. To reduce the risk of not only attacks, but also dangerous behavior in general, parents can: 
1. Be interested in your child's life. It sounds primitive, but you, as a parent, should know the child. About his feelings, experiences, goals and interests. Find out through conversation where the child is going, with whom he is friends, what sites he visits and what he posts in his social networks. If you find out that the child has a passion for violence, weapons, etc., you should seek professional help and not ignore that. 
2. Pay attention to bad reviews about a child. Imagine, you were told that your son or daughter attacked classmates. Or draw a drawing where someone is killing somebody. In case of a complaint, seek professional help or try to sort it out yourself since this kind of problem will be a cause of future problems. 
3. Store weapons in places where the child has no access. If you have a weapon, keep it in a safe. Never give Children access to it. Even if you and your children are fond of hunting for example. 
Developed relationship among students at school 
The topic is quite difficult to understand and explain, so we will try to explain everything with examples. 
We believe that the relationship between classmates can be improved through team building and project - collaborative work. 
1) Many students do the work on their own because they believe intelligence is a privilege and cannot be shared. But intelligence is a gift and it should serve for the good, so we believe that it is necessary to reward those students who explained something to someone who did not understand the topic. It can improve relationships and it motivates children to help others until it becomes a habit. This help should not in any way affect the assessment negatively. According to our calculations, this should increase the estimate by 15-20 percent. 
2) Team Building - we believe that team building also affects children's relationships. Banal sports games can improve relationships. We believe that 2-3 sports games (soccer, basketball, volleyball, baseball and more), board games (uno, chess, jenga, and more). Take an hour a day while studying for these activities. We advise schools to think about buying board games and
allocating places for spending their free time in schools (classrooms with sofas, books, TV sets, etc.) so that children can comfortably spend time there with benefit and pleasure at least 500 square meters in total. get kids to play with each other. Prizes. Let's say the winning team has chocolates. Need an incentive to teamwork 
3) Project and teamwork during a lesson or school year. We want to develop a system by which children will work with each other. The idea is that in a quarter, each student should work with each student in teamwork in the lesson and divide the entire class into three or four groups to give them 
project work. Project work or teamwork during the lesson without underestimating the grade should motivate work in teams. Teamwork should only increase the grade. In theory, all of this should improve relationships and communication skills. Collaboration work throughout a lesson. For instance, in a chemistry lesson, a teacher divides the work into two or three, so the material will be absorbed better, plus relationships between classmates will develop. As mentioned earlier, each student in a quarter should work with each classmate and get a grade. According to our calculations, 5-10 percent is the best way to attract children to work with each other. project work. Imagine that you are a teacher and you saw a group of children with common interests. Give them a topic for the project as an assignment, we believe that the project will create a great company. you need to try to do so that everyone in the class participates in projects. For this we advise you to introduce prize-winning places in order to lure the children.<br><br><br>
<h1>Counteraction and minimization of consequences</h1>
Referring to the Better Relationships program, we hope that it will be able to prevent the appearance of an aggressive environment, respectively, the appearance of the shooter's cheekbones. But unfortunately in our time we cannot be absolutely sure. In any case, there are always exceptions to the rules, as we discussed earlier, there is a category of shooters who are mentally ill. Their motives and reasons are unknown to anyone, therefore, it is not possible to prevent them at the stage of the formation. This is an example from many other situations. We still do not exclude that these rules will also to some extent help in other attacks on the school that are not related to school shooting, such as terrorist attacks or hostage-taking. After doing a little research, we came to the conclusion that most people do not know the rules of behavior in such situations at all. Even the most persistent can panic and commit rash actions that lead to disastrous results. 
MOTIVATION 
The main goal of this program is to identify the shooter and to minimize such accidents. Also, one of the most important goals is to educate people about the rules of behavior when attacking. 
We will analyze: 
1) Necessary requirements for educational institutions in order to prevent and minimize school shootings 
2) Rules of Conduct for Attacks on a School 
3) Revealing signs of intent 
REQUIREMENTS FOR EDUCATIONAL 
INSTITUTIONS 
1) Availability of qualified and professional security guards with non-lethal-traumatic weapons 
2) CCTV camera system 
3) The presence of a panic button 
4) Access control in educational institutions 
5) The presence of a metal detector 
1
SECURITY: 
Most often, various violations are observed at this point, since the person holding this position is not suitable mentally or physically. The HR department must carefully select employees for this position. A person must be physically strong in order to put up decisive resistance to the attacker. Also, he must be extremely careful, because most often the school shooter smuggles weapons secretly. In such situations, the deductive and analytical skills of the guard will be required. The number of security personnel is also a very important factor, everything should depend on the size of the institution and the number of students. But the rule "The more the better" - works great in this situation. Each guard must be equipped with self-defense equipment. Not lethal, but varying in severity. It is not necessary to have it with you, but it should be at hand. The following self-defense means such as rubber truncheons, traumatic pistols, gas cans, shockers and teasers are suitable for this task. The guards are the first and only physical shield between the threat and the children until the force team arrives. 
CAMERA SYSTEM: 
Cameras are the eyes and ears of the school, they are closely related to the security. The sooner the guards know about the incident, the more time it will take to take action. The cameras also help to identify the number of victims, the location of the shooter and provide an overview of the whole picture. After the incident, cameras will help the investigation to reveal the full history of the incident. 
ALARM BUTTON: 
Performs the same function as cameras, notifies everyone about the danger. Also, when pressed, there will be an automatic call to the rescue services. 
The presence of such buttons is a mandatory requirement for all institutions. 
NOTIFICATION SYSTEM: 
To identify the danger is the floor of the problem, the second part of the problem is to promptly notify all people about the problem. Loudspeakers, alarms, social media chats, applications, etc. are suitable for this concept. Anything that can alert you to danger. Articulating the hazard and coordinating the actions of children is the way to avoid casualties. Therefore, many agencies should consider an effective communication method. 
PASS MODE: 
Each educational institution must control the passage of people to the school grounds. By passes, QR codes or other means. Search and examination of suspicious people is included in this list. Keeping the shooter out of the way will help buy time or completely neutralize the threat at the entrance. Also included in this category are metal detectors and metal detectors that can help identify huge metal objects such as knives and firearms.

RULES OF CONDUCT DURING SCHOOL SHOOTING: 
INTRODUCTION: 
We hope that you will never need this information in real life, but in any case, you should definitely read the tips that we give below. They will not only save you, but also the people around you. It is better to know what to do and never face it than not to know what to do when it happens. Forewarned is forearmed. 
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ADMINISTRATIONS AND MANUALS OF EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS: 
Based on our research, we came to the conclusion that absolutely no one knows what to do in such cases, neither the teacher nor the students. How to solve this problem? Our program fully talks about this problem and each of its individual aspects, but we will list other steps that can be taken to minimize the consequences. To discuss with teachers a plan of action in such cases, to conduct trainings. Conduct frequent checks to improve evacuation efficiency. 
ACTIONS THAT SHOULD NOT BE DONE: 
We are all human and you should never forget about it, but in this case, the manifestation of mercy can lead to disastrous consequences. 
DO NOT ATTEMPT TO RELAX THE SHOOTER: 
We all would like to become the key to solving the problem, to save everyone. But first you need to understand the motives. According to research conducted by psychologists, the condition that the School Shooter is experiencing is similar to that of a suicidal person. They came to die in these schools, they came to kill themselves. This is a completely uncontrollable emotion. It is impossible to persuade a person to lay down their arms if they intend to eventually kill themselves. The success of the negotiations is extremely low, after each subsequent sacrifice the chance of success of the negotiations is significantly reduced, tending to zero. 
Do not negotiate with the shooter, this puts your life and the lives of others in great danger. For all your kindness, unfortunately you cannot help this person, it is too late. 
DON'T PANIC: 
It's hard not to succumb to such an extreme environment where your life is close to death, but just because of this you should stop worrying. You need a sound mind that is interrupted by panic and a huge level of adrenaline. You must realize that panic will not help here, but will only aggravate the situation. There are a couple of techniques that can help you deal with stress and pressure. You should look at the ceiling, then at the floor and mentally understand that you are here and now, in this place, in this moment. With peace of 
3
mind, you can make more rational decisions that will help not only you but others to survive as well. 
DO NOT TAKE A VIDEO: 
A common mistake among people is recording everything on camera. Many people with the goal of becoming famous, instead of following the steps below, start filming a video. This is very dangerous because you are putting your life and not only your own danger. 
RULES OF ACTION FOR SСHOOL SHOOTING 
Hearing shots or alarms, you have very little time to think and make the right decision. But after reading this material, you will be fully aware of all the nuances and will act correctly. There is an effective strategy for surviving mass shootings. Strategy: Run, Hide, Fight. 
1) Run - quickly leave dangerous territory 
2) Find a safe place and wait for rescue 
3) Provide resistance 
Below we will look at each of the sub-points and explain all aspects of when you need to adhere to a particular strategy. 
RUN: 
WHEN TO USE: 
If you can roughly understand the location of the shooter, then you should leave dangerous territory as soon as possible, if possible. When moving, you should not run along the same trajectory, you should move from cover to cover to warn people about the danger along the way. Do it in clear, short phrases. People under stress do not accept long commands. Try not to draw the shooter's attention or get caught in his field of vision 
WHEN TO NOT USE: 
If the process of flight exposes a person to more danger than that which is now or is expected in the near future, then this strategy must be abandoned. You should not run if the school shooter is next to you and your escape route is within the shooter's target area. You cannot run in dense groups, this will attract extra attention. Don't run in open space. 
HIDE: 
If you did not manage to leave the dangerous territory, then proceed to this step. It is required to find a safe room with a lot of furniture: chairs, tables, and wardrobes. 1) The first step is to barricade, the more people the more effective and faster this process will be, and it can also be improved by conducting trainings. Barricades can be done in a variety of ways. Use straps and other ropes to tie the doorknob and door into a heavy object, and move tables, chairs and cabinets close to the door.

2) Make it look like an empty class, hide, turn off the lights. Also an important point is to turn off the sound on mobile devices.As previously dismantled the school shooter acts chaotically, without noticing anyone in the office, he will not take measures to penetrate. 
3) Lie on the floor. You have to understand: a person shoots either from the shoulder or from the belt. We must be below the line of fire. Therefore, the teacher's task is to order the children to lie on the floor in the first seconds. The attacker will take time to realize that the children are below. 
FIGHT: 
Considering this situation, it would not be the best solution to enter into direct confrontation, but when this remains your only path to survival, you should be aware of the correct technique of action. It is worth thinking about entering a confrontation at the previous stage and being ready for anything. Most often, the shooters' weapons are long smooth-bore carbines, in the US there can be any weapon. It is also worth remembering edged weapons. Tactics should be adapted to the type of weapon. 
1) Use the environment to your advantage. Hide in corners, doorways, etc. Any means for a covert attack and disarmament. 
2) Attack in a crowd, quick coordinated actions of a large number of people will be able to disarm the shooter. Divide everyone's roles and actions. 
3) If the opponent is right-handed, dive and dodge to the left and vice versa. 4) Consider who is behind you, because when trying to attack and disarm, the shooter can make shots that can injure those standing behind. Aim the muzzle at the ceiling. 
WHEN TO NOT USE: 
1) If you are not confident in your abilities and panic seized you 
2) When confrontation can be avoided 
NOTE: 
Use only at the very end, with a hopeless option. Don't be a hero. 
RESCUE STAGE:

FIRST AID: 
Most deaths do not occur immediately, the main cause of death is painful shock and bleeding. There is no way you can help a person with a painful shock. To help a person, you must know a number of rules about the first one in case of a bullet wound. It all depends on where the bullet hits. 
1) Anesthesia (nalbuphine, ketorolac, dexalgin, analgin intramuscularly). 2) Applying an aseptic dressing to the gunshot wound, preferably 3) using a sterile dressing bag; stopping external bleeding (pressing dressing, applying a tourniquet); 3) Immobilization of the limb. 
After completing these procedures, you can stop bleeding and save a person's life. But save your life only if it is safe for your own life and does not endanger you. 
What details to look out for to prevent school shooting 
● Significant personal loss, humiliation, or setback that is either real or perceived ● Inability yo perceive or lack of interest in pursuing non-violent resolutions to a grievance 
● Deliberate or inadvertent disclosure of violent plans or of impending ominous events; verbal/written expressions of intent to commit highly dramatic acts(against self or others) in the near future. 
● Persuasive, persistent fantasies where the offender victimizes others through dominant violence. 
● Increasingly problematic or concerning interpersonal interactions with others. Others are concerned that the individual may become violent. 
● Significantly diminished resilience or compromised ability to cope with stressors or setbacks 
● Increased isolation, depression, and withdrawal from normally pleasurable activities. Decreased performance at school (may appear to be in a “downward spiral”). ● Contextually inappropriate or dramatically escalated interest in past attacks or attackers. 
● Contextually inappropriate or dramatically escalated interest in obtaining firearms and/or explosives. 
● Contextually inappropriate accumulation of or escalated interest in tactical gear, clothing or paraphernalia. 
● Evaporating buffers and fading obstacles to violence (e.g. diminishing fear of death/incarceration; loss of stabilizing family member)
