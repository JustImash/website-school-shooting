  <div class="field field-name-field-body-text field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p>This page lists and explains the organizing concepts used on the site to distinguish different types of shooters and different types of attacks.
    Despite frequent references in the media to a “profile” of school shooters, there is no one profile. Based on my research, however, shooters tend to fall into one of three psychological types:
    Psychopathic shooters are narcissistic, entitled, lacking in empathy, and sometimes sadistic. Some are abrasive and belligerent; others are charming and deceptive.
    Psychotic shooters have either schizophrenia or schizotypal personality disorder, with a combination of psychotic symptoms (hallucinations, delusions, disorganized thoughts/behavior), eccentric behavior and beliefs, and severely impaired social/emotional functioning.
    Traumatized shooters grew up in chronically dysfunctional families characterized by parental substance abuse, domestic violence, physical abuse, sometimes sexual abuse, frequent relocations, and changing caregivers.
    The degree of confidence with which I classify shooters in one of these three groups varies. In some cases, there is abundant, consistent evidence to support the classification. In other cases, the evidence is scant and/or inconsistent, resulting in more tentative classification. When there was too little evidence (or I simply haven’t studied the shooter sufficiently) the shooter has not been categorized. In several cases, the shooters fit two of these categories.
    The shooters are also grouped into one of three populations:
    Secondary school shooters includes those perpetrators who were current or recent (within three years) students at the middle or high schools they attacked. (The one exception is Brenda Spencer; she was a high school student who attacked the elementary school she had attended.)
    College shooters includes those perpetrators who were current or recent students or employees at the colleges or universities they attacked.
    Aberrant adult shooters includes those perpetrators who had no current or recent connection to the schools they attacked. (This group also includes Jiverly Wong, whose attack was aberrant only in terms of the location, which was not a primary school, secondary school, or institution of higher education.)
    Lastly, attacks are categorized by attack type:
    Random: these attacks have no specific victims or groups of victims.
    Targeted individuals: these attacks were directed against specific people known to the perpetrators.
    Targeted groups: these attacks were directed against specific groups of people, such as females or children, who were not known to the perpetrator.
    Mixed: these attacks included both targeted and random victims.
    These categories are not absolute. For example, some attacks were largely targeted against specific people, with a random person being shot who was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. Though these could be considered mixed attacks, if the overall thrust of an attack was targeted, it is classified as a targeted attack. In some cases, the attacks were too ambiguous to be categorized.
    Killed and Wounded
    The numbers in these fields are not always definite. In the incidents involving two perpetrators it is not known for certain which victims were killed or wounded by which shooter. Thus, there is subjectivity involved. Also, different sources count wounded victims differently (e.g., only those wounded by gunfire, or those wounded by gunfire plus those injured while escaping, or hurt by other means, such as smoke inhalation). As a result, the number of victims listed here may differ from those found in some sources. The numbers used here include those hurt more or less directly by the shooters’ violent intention. Thus, someone who sprained an ankle while fleeing is not counted, but someone injured by shattered glass from a near miss by a bullet is counted. This level of detail, however, is not always available. If the shooter died during the attack, this is not counted in the number killed.</p>

    <h1>The reasons and common features of killers</h1>
    <p>Cases occur in different places at different times.
      But what unites them?
      They all had a common cultural environment in which they were for a long time. After a detailed study of each case, we can come to the conclusion that they are united by the following facts:
      Problems in the family
      Constant bullying (cyber-bullying, bullying)
      Possible psychological deviations.
      
      It was believed that all this was influenced by violent films, games, etc. but this is inappropriate since a book, a song, a novel, a poem or anything else can be a catalyst.
      
      The child may have a predisposition to psychopathy and environmental factors such as fights with parents or bullying by other people can make the situation worse. Head of the Department of Psychological Assistance and Resocialization of the Faculty of Psychology of Moscow State University, Doctor of Psychology Madrudin Magomed-Eminov explains how the image of exclusivity is formed in a person who takes up arms: “On the basis of bloodthirsty scenes in mass culture and social networks and internal grievances, an obsessive state arises: a person becomes a monster obsessed with their exclusivity and superiority. Common everyday grievances cause a thirst for revenge that fills his mind. At this moment, two factors activate the “monster” to act: examples of similar situations and the desire to show that “I myself have the right”
      As it turned out, none of the attacks on the school were accidental or impulsive. All attacks were planned for a long time. In some cases, school shooters asked friends for help or discussed who they wanted to kill. In 80% of cases, the impending attack was known - at least one person knew about it, in addition to the attackers themselves. In some cases, friends and classmates even knew the date and time, in others - only that the shooter was "preparing to do something bad."</p>

<h1>Examples</h1>
<p>The Columbine Case

  This problem emerged recently, at the beginning of this century. The first high-profile-recorded case of armed attacks on educational institutions occurred in the United States at a high school in Columbine. Two students subjected to humiliation, for several years, by students and teachers, developed a plan to attack the school. They wrote a diary of how they would torture each student. Armed with weapons, grenades and explosives, they attacked the school, killing 13 people (12 students and one teacher) and wounding 23 people, after which the attackers shot themselves. Investigators in the course of the proceedings established the cause of the attack using the found diary. This incident did not go unnoticed: CNN and Fox News received high ratings for the story, and many documentaries were shot. Due to the popularity of this case, various subcultures began to appear, as a result of which fans and imitators of the so-called "began to appearColumbiners". 
   Columbine has become, in a sense, a subculture. Someone comes to this topic simply out of interest, but does not linger in it. Someone, faced with bullying from personal experience, is looking for the same adolescents, because they do not receive support anywhere else, but here they meet with those who understand it and, receiving support, cope with adequate ways in real life with their difficulties. All    this can only create the likelihood of training. Most adolescents still don't do anything. But a small part may be too vulnerable, the effect of imitation may work, the desire to become widely known, personal attitudes can also increase the risk of such an outcome. Some adolescents and young adults in general may be influenced by toxic content or excessive relishing of school-shooting situations in the media and the Internet. Unfortunately, the media often provide contradictory, unverified information, which quickly becomes overgrown with some details that have nothing to do with what happened. In other words, when unreliable information multiplies, a snowball of guesses and assumptions arises. Therefore, it is important that information is presented tactfully, correctly, without savoring details. And this is not a question of censorship, but an account of responsibility and consequences.
  At some point, they began to monitor this phenomenon on the network, for example, VKontakte began to delete posts with the hashtags Columbine, etc. 
  Kazan shooter 
  
  Relatively recent incident in the cauldron shocked the whole world, especially Russia. The former student of the school became angry with the students and the entire teaching staff of this school. For some unknown reason, he himself said that at some point he felt like a "God" and decided to attack the school. He opened a channel in Telegram, where there were several dozen subscribers from his circle. An hour before the incident, he wrote a post in which he noted that he was going to destroy a lot of bio-waste. He killed 9 people (7 school students and 2 teachers) and injured 21 people. Now the Kazan shooter was sent to a psychiatric hospital.
  Shooter portrait. The guy is 19 years old, calm and reserved in appearance, even after he wrote this post, no one paid due attention to this. All friends could not believe that he was capable of such, as a result of which no measures were taken. This case is very similar to Columbine in that after the attack, a fan base appeared around him, many Internet users considered him attractive and cute, thinking that he did not deserve such a punishment. 
   
  Mass murder at Virginia Polytechnic University
  
      autism developed into manic schizophrenia, which influenced him to commit mass murder.
  At first, at the university, his classmates and neighbors in the hostel tried to find a common language with him and make friends. But since the future killer did not behave in the best way, i.e. he often photographed the legs of female students and wrote obscene verses about them in poetry lessons, threatened others with violence, harassed female students, etc. 
  December 13, 2005 - Future killer was diagnosed with progressive schizophrenia and declared in need of treatment. In a conversation with a psychiatrist, he said that he was constantly depressed by something, andvisited him with suicidal thoughts. The killer was also not found to pose an immediate danger to all students.</p>
